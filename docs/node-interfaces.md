# Node Interfaces

Interfaces are used to receive data from other nodes (*input interfaces*) or send data to other nodes (*output interfaces*). A node interface has two important properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <p>**name**</p> | <p>The name is displayed to the user. You also need the name to get the value of the interface</p> |
| <p>**type**</p> | <p> The type can be any string. For more information, see [Node Interface Types](/interface-types.md)</p> |

An input interface, which is not connected, can display a node option to allow the user to change its value.
